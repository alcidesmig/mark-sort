# markSort
- MarkSort is a sort that seeks to sort a set of numbers without make comparisons between them.
### Results
- Comparisons between MarkSort and others sorts are being made, and tests with MarkSort be made by changing the parameters set at the beginning of the programs.

#### Parameters
- NUMERICAL_RANGE: the highest value in the set of numbers.
- NUM_VALUES: the amount of values in the number set.
- NUM_LOOPS: the number of sorts to be made
- Obs: values printed on documents are in microseconds.

#### Observations
- (01/07/19): I heard about a very similar sort, called Counting Sort. Now its time to make this sort special.
